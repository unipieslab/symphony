Nominal Voltage
PMD = 980 mV
SOC = 950 mV

Safe Voltage Level
PMD = 930 mV
SOC = 910 mV

Voltage Combinations for Beaming
PMD -  SOC
980 - 950
960 - 940
940 - 930
930 - 920
--> For combined PMD+SOC undervolting, it's required to type only the desired PMD voltage level, and the script will automatically choose the correct SOC voltage.

Running the Script:
There are two arguments: the first denotes the voltage domain (PMD, SOC, or ALL) and the second denotes the desired voltage level in mV.

For example:
Unvervolting only the PMD domain (i.e., SOC domain remains at its nominal value): ./voltset PMD 960
Unvervolting only the SOC domain (i.e., PMD domain remains at its nominal value): ./voltset SOC 920
Unvervolting only the PMD + SOC domains: ./voltset ALL 930
