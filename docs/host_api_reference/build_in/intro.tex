There are repeatedly implemented cases in a radiation-based experiment where at least one device is exposed to a source of high ionizing radiation. Such scenarios, for instance, are to monitor the devices that are being tested and to handle operations such as resetting a crashed device due to high radiation. For this reason, Symphony has implemented some built-in functions that could accelerate the development process.

Following this section, the user will learn about the available built-in functions.
