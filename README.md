# Symphony

TCP/IP server/client framework to orchestrate the execution of benchmarks on a traget device with Python.

## Introduction

This is a project to automate the process of testing benchmarks at different voltages. It includes classes and methods to manage the test process, collect and save results, and handle errors.

## Documentation
The documentation for the Symphony framework can be found in the **docs** directory, located in the root folder of the current repository. There are two entries in this directory. The first is the API reference for the **Host** module of the framework, the second consists of the **DUT** API reference for the framework and, the third is the user manual, where you should start looking to get familiar with the framework.

## Bug report
This is an open-source framework that can be used for executing experiments, thus we would appreciate any contribution in case where a bug is found. Bug reports can be sent either by getting in contact with the framework's maintainers or by opening an issue in the current repository.
