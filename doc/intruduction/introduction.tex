The provided user manual is associated with a Python-based framework called \textbf{Symphony}, which is utilized for conducting radiation-based experiments. Difficulty and safety during such experiments are the most significant factors; thus, Symphony is designed to prevent human interference, using the network infrastructure and various micro-controllers, like \textbf{Raspberry Pi}, to control situations that otherwise would demand humans to interfere. 

The forenamed framework uses the \textbf{client-server} architecture to acquire the necessary features. This architecture typically uses two distinct systems, one that plays the role of the server side and the other that plays the role of the client side. Both the server and client, according to Symphony's terminology, can be referred to with a unique name. The server side can be called \textbf{Device Under Test (DUT)}, while the Client side is the \textbf{Host}.
