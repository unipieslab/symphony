#Problems
Monitor power and temperature while running a benhmark is not working

#Questions
Q1) Do we need to monitor the power and temp during the execution of a benchmark or simply to report voltage and freq. at the end of the execution?
Q2) Could you provide a non safe voltage to test the framework ?
